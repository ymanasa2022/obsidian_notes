## *Cysteine cathepsins as a prospective target for anticancer therapiesâ€”current progress and prospects*
### Lit Review 

#### Relevance
cysteine cathepsins can be used as a prospective target for anticancer therapies 
**CTS** (Cysteine Cathepsins) have been highly up-regulated in a wide variety of cancer types 
neoplastic progression have revealed secretion of proteases in tumor cells 
CTS play a role in carcinogens so inhibition is good strat for cancer therapy 
natural CTS inhibitors (CTSsis-- ex, cystatins) are down regulated in cancers 

#### Intro 
CTS is part of cysteine proteases (CP)
CPs belong to hydrolases
They are cysteine proteases 
exopeptidase: these peptidases cleave at the N-term and C-term of substrates  
endopeptidases: internally in the polypeptide chain 
C1 (papain-line cysteine peptidase family) is best characterized group 

#### Roles
nonsepcific protein turnover within endolysosomal pathway (digestion of proteins)
highly specialized roles like tissue homeostasis 
in mammals: lysosomal cathepsins. 11 identified in humans (B, C, F, H, L, K, O, S, V,  X, W)
structures [solved for everything except](gaps_and_ideas.md#gap1) lysosomal cathepsins O and W 

#### Location 
when C1s are in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, the reducing (acidic) environment prevents oxidation of the thiol group in its AS and thus help activation of cathepsins 

#### Activation & Inhibition
regulation of CTS is done by zymogen activation, pH, small-molecular inhibitors 
mannose-6-phosphate moiety functions as [recognition marker](gaps_and_ideas.md#idea1) 
acidic conditions activate [zymogen](gaps_and_ideas.md#idea2) 
in lysosomes, enzymes get activated by controlled [autocatalysis or transactivation](gaps_and_ideas.md#idea3)
