##### gap1
in mammals: lysosomal cathepsins. 11 identified in humans (B, C, F, H, L, K, O, S, V,  X, W)
structures solved for everything except lysosomal cathepsins O and W

##### idea1
find a way to take out mannose-6-phosphate moiety recognition marker to stop binding to receptor in Golgi and hence stop transportation to lysosomes 

##### idea2 
maybe we can artificially control acidic conditions to activate the inactive protein (generally known as zymogen) or deactivate the protein to control its lysosomal protease activity 

#### idea3
inhibition of autocatalysis or transactivation can maybe prevent activation of CTPs in lysosomes

#### idea4
need to be wary of how much we are inhibiting CTPs with natural or artificial inhibitors. what experimental studies can we do to find out what the sweet spot is to inhibit CTPs but not cause a deficiency? 

#### idea5
inhibitors can be modeled with cystatin C in mind. enzyme-cystatin interaction is not a simple reaction with the catalytic cysteine residue of the cysteine protease. the interaction relies on hydrophobic contacts between the binding regions of cystain and binding pockets of the enzyme. cystatins do not react with the catalytic center which is what we may want from potential therapeutics
