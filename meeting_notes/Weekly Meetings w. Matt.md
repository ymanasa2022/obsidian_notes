## Things discussed: 
1. To make the most of grad school
	- go to at least one seminar per week
	- go to ALL DCMB department events
	- go to at least one big conference per year 
1. NSF GRFP grant
	-  October 16th, 2023 deadline
	- Funds 3 years of research
	- Have a draft in a month (Sept 15 draft deadline).
2. BIDS-TP training grant
	- May 1st, 2024 deadline
3. Important Docking issues: in which situations will we need to get accurate simulations of these issues and which ones can we skip to speed up simulations/computations?
	- water modeling: might be done using diffusion models
	- receptor flexibility
	- handling metals, covalent interactions
	- quantum chemistry: orbits, charge transfer etc 
	
## To do:
1. Administrative
	- [x] set up obsidian on macbook and ipad
	- [x] update calendar with grant dates
	- [ ] go through onboarding doc 
	- [x] sign up for mentor mentee workshop 
	- [x] send itemized bill from apple
	- [ ] add yourself to appropriate mailing lists
	- [ ] share this github repo with Matt
