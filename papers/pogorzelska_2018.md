## *Cysteine cathepsins as a prospective target for anticancer therapiesâ€”current progress and prospects*

### Relevance
-cysteine cathepsins can be used as a prospective target for anticancer therapies 
-**CTS** (Cysteine Cathepsins) have been highly up-regulated in a wide variety of cancer types 
-neoplastic progression have revealed secretion of proteases in tumor cells 
-CTS play a role in carcinogens so inhibition is good strat for cancer therapy 
-natural CTS inhibitors (CTSsis-- ex, cystatins) are down regulated in cancers 
-CTS are secreted by tumor cells

### Intro 
-CTS is part of cysteine proteases (CP)
-CPs belong to hydrolases
-They are cysteine proteases 
-exopeptidase: these peptidases cleave at the N-term and C-term of substrates  
-endopeptidases: internally in the polypeptide chain 
-C1 (papain-line cysteine peptidase family) is best characterized group 
-in mammals: lysosomal cathepsins. 11 identified in humans (B, C, F, H, L, K, O, S, V,  X, W)
-structures [solved for everything except](gaps_ideas.md#pogorzelska_2018#gap1) lysosomal cathepsins O and W 

### Roles
-nonsepcific protein turnover within endolysosomal pathway AKA lysosomal protein degradation
-highly specialized roles like tissue homeostasis 
-proliferation and growth of cancer cells 

### Location 
-when C1s are in the endosomal-lysosomal compartment, the reducing (acidic) environment prevents oxidation of the thiol group in its AS and thus help activation of cathepsins 
-CTS are expressed with tissue and cell specificity and they contribute to protein degradation and turnover
-exception: cathepsin S can process and present antigens in less acidic endosomal compartments  
-can also be in nucleus, cell membrane, cystol
-secreted into extracellular environment by tumor cells (contributes to cancer progression)

### Activation & Inhibition
-regulation of CTS is done by zymogen activation, pH, small-molecular inhibitors 
-mannose-6-phosphate moiety functions as [recognition marker](gaps_ideas.md#pogorzelska_2018#idea1) 
-acidic conditions activate [zymogen](gaps_ideas.md#pogorzelska_2018#idea2) 
-in lysosomes, enzymes get activated by controlled [autocatalysis or transactivation](gaps_ideas.md#pogorzelska_2018#idea3) 
most important: inhibition of the active enzyme by endogenous protein inhibitors 

### Issues of Inhibiting CTS
-gene-targeted knock out animal models show that [deficiencies of CTSs](gaps_ideas.md#pogorzelska_2018#idea4) can result in lethal consequences such as brain atrophy, impaired osteoclastic bone resorption and autosomal recessive skeletal dysplasia 

### Pathology
-Cysteine cathepsins are involved in inflammation, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, bronchial asthma, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis and many types of cancer

##### Cancer Progression
-CTS help growth and development of tumors 
-involved in angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis
-increased expression of CTS correlates with more aggressive tumors
-important therapeutic target and prognostic marker for cancer
-cathepsins B, L , K and S are most important for cancer dev 
-GOOD FIGURE: Fig. 6 shows the role of cysteine cathepsins in tumor metastasis

##### Cathepsin B (CTSB)
-well studied for its role in cancer dev
-ideal microenvironment for tumor growth: low pH 
-low pH also ideal for CTSB digestive process which will facilitate migration of tumor cells through extracellular space 
-role of CTSB in autophagy and tumor cannibalism is unclear

### Inhibitors 
##### Endogenous Cysteine Cathepsin Inhibitors
-cystatins family of proteins are reversible competitive inhibitors of cysteine proteases 
-stefin A and B/cystatin A and B protect skin and epithelium against overactivity of cysteine proteases 
	- decreased expression of stefin A correlates with [increased cathepsin B expression](gaps_ideas#pogorzelska_2018#idea6)
-kininogens are multi-domain glycoproteins 
-Cystatin C is the most potent inhibitor of cysteine cathepsins 
	- Cystatins block the access of substrate by the adjacent binding to the active site but [do not interact with the catalytic center](gaps_ideas.md#pogorzelska_2018#idea5)
	- may control promotion or suppression of tumor growth, invasion and metastasis 
##### Exogenous Inhibitors of Cysteine Cathepsins 
(Figure 8)
-exhibit reactivity toward other proteinases 
-makes their use in cancer treatment problematic 
-although they might be good leads in drug discovery
	-cysteine peptidase inhibitor E-64 
	-synthetic inhibitors are 
	-contains an electrophilic functionality that allows for reaction with thiolate of the AS cysteine and peptide fragment for recognition by the enzyme
	-cathepsin B inhibitor: CA-074 and CA-030 
	-Nitroxoline is a quinolone antibiotic used for urinary infections and has been found to inhibit the growth of cancer. shows significant reduction of ECM degradation and inhibition of CTSB
	-cathepsin K inhibitors have reactive functional groups such as nitrile or aldehyde 
		-Odanacatib (MK-08222) is a covalent nitrile based peptidic derivative (failed clinical trials)

### Conclusions
-more insight into role of cathepsins in different cancers is needed
-understanding their role in cancer dev has been a challenge
-expression of cysteine cathepsins in various cancer cells is needed
-hard to make cathepsin inhibitors that dont affect CTS functions in [normal tissues]( gaps_ideas#pogorzelska_2018#idea7)
