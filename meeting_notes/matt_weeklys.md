## Things discussed 
1. To make the most of grad school
	- go to at least one seminar per week
	- go to ALL DCMB department events
	- go to at least one big conference per year 
2. NSF GRFP grant
	-  October 16th, 2023 deadline
	- Funds 3 years of research
	- Have a draft in a month (Sept 15 draft deadline).
3. BIDS-TP training grant
	- May 1st, 2024 deadline
4. Important Docking issues: in which situations will we need to get accurate simulations of these issues and which ones can we skip to speed up simulations/computations?
	- water modeling: might be done using diffusion models
	- receptor flexibility
	- handling metals, covalent interactions
	- quantum chemistry: orbits, charge transfer etc 
5. Future Directions:
	- targeting proteins with cofactors in Active Site or proteins with post translational modifications 
	- pre-training: clustering of info in interaction matrices of many receptors and ligands 
		- good clusters can be further refined using high resolution simulations 
		- lower quality clusters can be further investigated using computationally cheaper simulations
6. TgCPL 
	- creating a docking model to perform high through put screening of ligands against Toxo cathepsins 
	- model needs to perform well with existing ligands that have been experimentally docking to human cathepsin proteins in order to use it to predict ligand affinity to the Toxo Cathepsin 
	- curation of human cathepsin data is done in TgCPL activity sheet
7. Broader Qs plus goals
	- what are the controls, why are we testing, what are we testing, here's the baseline, what is the experiment, what did we find, what does this mean 
	- help biologists and chemistry to do docking themselves instead of needing an expert
	
## To do for the week
