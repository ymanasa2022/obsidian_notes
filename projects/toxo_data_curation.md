Working on organizing data into [TgCPL Activities](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lo0Nc6OFRyUe0arYsGTmi4eR1rFFTiq_GEcoAIC9rmE/edit?usp=sharing) from [experimental data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/0B7YNPpJXYWK8cnFVWXFxMWJhZDV4dmM3LVZvNmFldDlCbTJV/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=104609175179432674295&resourcekey=0-q9aMd3mjCopFToB8Kx_lEA&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Project outline:
1. Retrospective test:
	- assess current docking model with known experimentally docked ligands to TgCPL
		1. involves creating a data set with experimentally docked ligands and their binding efficiency values 
		2. having the structures of these docked ligands to the protein target 
		3. docking these known ligands to the protein target
		4. assessing rmsd values of docked vs experimentally determined ligand+protein complexes
	- Tweak docking model ?
2. Covalently Dock: 
	- use method to dock a library of commercially available ligand types assessed in previous step
		- might also need to manually make this based on retrospective testing results 
	- assess top-ranked 4.5% of the library 
	- purchase highest/medium ranked compounds and lowest ranked compounds similar to higher ranked commercially unavailable compounds 
3. Get co-crystal compounds of the most promising new ligands 
	- validate docking poses for highest ranked ligands
		- RMSD
1. experimentally test inhibition of protein by new ligands 
	- IC50
	- MIC
	- activity assays
	- full dose-response curves against protein target
