[https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.20.563287v1](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.20.563287v1)
- profiled reactivity changes in cysteines across 416 cell lines 
- identified cysteines in cancers that can be targeted by covalent drugs
- platform to aid in identification of molecules and structural features underlying cysteine ligandibility
- P2Rank and DeepPocket 
	- [P2Rank](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-018-0285-8)better than DeepPocket
	- identifies high confidence pockets/binding sites for small drugs 
## CSEA 
- cysteine set enrichment analysis 
- Cysteines are very reactive due to the sulfide and hence covalent inhibitors (electrophiles) are good candidates for inhibition 
- High throughput profiling of reactive cysteines: https://www.nature.com/articles/d41573-024-00008-4
