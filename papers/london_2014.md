## Covalent Docking of Large Libraries for the Discovery of Chemical Probes

### Abstract
-chemical probes that form covalent bonds with protein target show higher selectivity, higher potency and utility 
-but, protein0reactive compounds are avoiding in docking campaigns 
-method to screen electrophilic small molecule libraries 
-target: protein nucleophiles 
-web server: covalent.docking.org aims to help us find small molecules to test for activity against my biological target for which I have a structure

### Introduction 
-enhancing properties: covalent bond formation with nucleophilic residues in target and that are absent from off-targets
-warheads: reactive functional groups 
-[unsolved problem](gaps_ideas.md#london_2014#gap1): how to identify a protein-binding scaffold that orients the electrophile while minimizing number of compounds that much be synthesized and tested 
-[issue](gaps_ideas.md#london_2014#idea1): combining classical non-covalent scoring with covalent restrains and bond energies
-issue2: developing compound libraries suited to covalent modification of proteins 
-authors show how to adapt the non-covalent docking program DOCK3.6 to large-scale, covalent virtual screening of electrophilic small molecules 
	-nine libraries of ligands bearing diff electrophilic small molecules 
-DOCKovalent to screen compound libraries against three targets
