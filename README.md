# obsidian_notes
**notes made using obsidian**

All subjects are divided into sub folders in this vault.
A new vault for each sub folder is not created.
Everything should be viewable in my git repo: obsidian_notes

## *For syncing with iPad*
I followed these instructions: https://gist.github.com/DannyQuah/f686c0e43b741468e12515cd79017489 
For iPad notes, I created a separate branch called ipad_notes
### Normal work cycle 
1. Go to iPad > iSH
2. cd /mnt/ymanasa/Obsidian/obsidian_notes
	- Obsidian/ is not a git repo. obsidian_notes/ is the git repo 
3. git pull if needed (will need to if I make changes on laptop and git commit to main branch)
4. Work on iPad > Obsidian 
5. When done iPad > iSH, **git add, git commit -m ‘commit msg’, git push** to push to ipad_notes branch 
Need to git merge when changes on laptop or vice versa are made 

## *For syncing with MacBook*
