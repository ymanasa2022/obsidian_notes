##### gap1
in mammals: lysosomal cathepsins. 11 identified in humans (B, C, F, H, L, K, O, S, V,  X, W)
structures solved for everything except lysosomal cathepsins O and W

##### idea1
find a way to take out mannose-6-phosphate moiety recognition marker to stop binding to receptor in Golgi and hence stop transportation to lysosomes 

##### idea2 
maybe we can artificially control acidic conditions to activate the inactive protein (generally known as zymogen) or deactivate the protein to control its lysosomal protease activity 

#### idea3
inhibition of autocatalysis or transactivation can maybe prevent activation of CTPs in lysosomes
