## *Toxoplasma Gondii Cathepsin L is the Primary Target of the Invasion-inhibitory Compound Morpholinurea-leucyl-homophenyl-vinyl Sulfone Phenyl*

### Abstract
- Tg cysteine protease cathepsin L (TgCPL)
- LHVS was shown to inhibit parasite invasion by blocking the release of invasion proteins (such as TgCPL) 
- LHVS's primary target is TgCPL 
- LHVS fails to label cells lacking TgCPL in a study with targeted disruption of TgCPL 
- Authors give structural model of TgCPL inhibited by LHVS 2.0Å resolution 
- Discussion of roles for TgCPL as a protease in proteins involved in host invasion
### Introduction 
- five genes encoding cathepsin proteases (3 C and 1 B and 1L)
- T. gondii expresses two endogenous inhibitors (TgICP1 and TgICP2) 
- screening of small library of cathepsin and proteasome inhibitors identified two compounds that impair Tg cell invasion 
	- LHVS 
		- blocks parasite attachment and gliding motility by impairing release of invasion proteins

### Discussion 
- Properties of LHVS that facilitate identification of main target (TgCPL)
	- vinyl sulfone warhead of LHVS covalently modifies AS thiol of reactive cathepsin proteases (irreversible labeling)
	- BO-LHVS (fluorescent derivative of LHVS) helpful for labelling
	- specificity depends on inhibitor concentration used
- TgCPL is expressed in tachyzoite and bradyzoite cyst stage during chronic infection
