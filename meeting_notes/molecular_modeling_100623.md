# AI guided molecular design
Terra Sztain, Med Chem
- rosetta used for understanding how mutations in a protein affect the structures 
	- after rosetta used to model, mutation structures were experimentally validated
	- score term was tweaked in accordance to the experiments
- machine learning to reweigh rosetta score terms 
	- like electrostatics and vdw
	- kinetic info is lost about the protein folding when tweaking the scores too much 
		- transition paths
- computer aided drug design 

# Structural systems analysis 
- delta delta G measure of change in protein stability upon modification 
	- EvoEF computers delta delta G based on structure (energy function based approach)
