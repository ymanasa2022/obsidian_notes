Chemical IVAE provides stochastic representation 
CANONICAL SMILE vs NONCANONICAL 
SMILE strings are represented by matrices. each atom has a column and presence of an atom or bonds are denoted by 1/0 
each canonical SMILE is encoded as a one-hot matrix where the rows are indices of string and columns are characters representing atoms or other chemical properties
morgan fingerprints don't differentiate between stereochemical molecules
